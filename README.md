# WebBuilder
Content Management System (CMS) that Builds and Edits Websites

This CMS has integration with my custom MVCStructure therefore separating the logic into the Model
The UI into the Views and the functionality into theController.
It allows for a single entry point which is how many CMSs are built for security and convenience
It also uses a Rest API structure to do server side scripting 
And custom built routing to view different templates of the built websites
It uses a dashboard functionality which I built with the CMS in mind

Technologies used:
Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL

Libraries: JQuery

Architecture: MVC, Rest API
